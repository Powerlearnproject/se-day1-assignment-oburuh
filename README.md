# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering involves the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products. 
It is important as it allows for the creation of reliable, scalable and innovative software solutions that meet user needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages
The rise of agile methodologies
The advent of structured programming

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - Gathering user needs and software requirements
Design- Creating high level and detailed design of software
Implementation- Writing code and building software according to design specifications
Testing- To ensure the software meets quality standards
Deployment- Releasing it to users
Maintenance- Future support and updates

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is sequential and with phases while agile methodology is iterative and incremental. Waterfall  method would be appropriate in
projects that requirements may change. Agile metghodology would be appropriate would be appropriate in projects that are iterative.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer writes code, a quality engineer ensures the softwware meets user needs, project manager coordinates the planning and execution of projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide tools for writing and debugging code eg visual studio. VCSs track changes to source code and coordinating work among teams. eg Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements
Tight deadlines
Technical debts

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit involves testing individual components of software
Integration involves testing interactions between different components.
System involves the entire software
Acceptance involves testing against user requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
This is crafting questions to get the best responses from AI models. It is important as it curates the exact prompt a user requires.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Explain role o technology.    Explain the role of technology in sectors such as entertainment, tourism providing clear examples.
